This is not the main node_modules dir.
The only reason this directory was created is due to an error seen in the github
actions from the deployment script that ran when code was pushed to staging.

From the summary on github the Build js step would "succeed" but display this
error:
```
ERROR in ./tree-map/client/client.scss
Module build failed: ModuleNotFoundError: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory' ./../node_modules/font-awesome/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot in /home/runner/work/TreeMap/TreeMap/tree-map/client
    at /home/runner/work/TreeMap/TreeMap/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compilation.js:229:38
```

the client.scss file on this branch clearly showed `./../../node_modules/font-awesome/`
so why is the extra `../` getting lost?

its bonkers to me that this code works locally and fails in the github action.
I created the expected dir and move the requested files into it, to get it
working.

This is not a great solution, improvements welcome.
